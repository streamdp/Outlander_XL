# Outlander_XL
My version of calibrations for Mitsubishi Outlander 3.0 AT FWD. Economical firmware with smooth response to the accelerator pedal and minimal delays for down and up gears. Minimized kick from 1 to 2 gear. I am attaching additionally developments on rome_meta_data for 5029 and 5201 ecu versions for EcuFlash. Many calibrations unknown to me, be careful when editing them. Average fuel consumption in the spring-summer period is 11.5 L. Not tested in winter. The work is provided as is, without warranty.

Do not forget to make a backup of your firmware :)
